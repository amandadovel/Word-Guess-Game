# Word-Guess-Game

Using HTML, CSS and Javascript I created a simple hangman game. User has 10 guesses to fill in the blanks for the chosen word. There are about 6 words that will be selected at random. At the end of the game user will be notified if they have won or lost and the game will give total wins and losses. Letters already guessed will be shown on the screen, and user will be notifed to guess another letter if they have already guessed the one chosen.
